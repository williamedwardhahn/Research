Particle swarm optimization is a family of heuristic search algorithms that rely on in the injection of outside noise for the generation of new potential solutions. Typically this noise is drawn from a normal or uniform distribution and acts to destabilize solutions at local minima. Heavy-tailed (alpha-stable) distributions have been shown to be advantageous when searching for randomly and sparsely distributed resources, yet research remains limited because closed form analytic expressions for these non-Gaussian distributions are not available. Inspired by measured animal movement patterns, we employ alpha stable distributions to drive a particle swarm optimization scheme that finds an appropriate set of weights in a feed forward neural network.
